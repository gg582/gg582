## üß† Research Assistant Certificates
![Researches](./certs.png)
The award was focused on presentation.
Plus, there can be some problem while uploading collaborated code into this.
So, I attach the actual award.

![Awards](./award.png)
![IndustrialEngineer](./industrial_engineer.png)
This is a Korean certificates, for informational engineering. 

This is not 'high-leveled' certificates. But this needs some comments. 

I took the Industrial Engineer examination's first screening while I was not yet an undergraduate student.

Engineer certificates do not allow people who have graduated from a four-year college.

Also, colleges with 2 years courses cannot take this. In my opinion it is a kind of system limitation.

And I took a final test in 2025. If I can get enough time to get 'Engineer' examination,

which is one step higher than 'Industrial Engineer', I have courage to take.

The first screening pass rate was 51%. The final test's pass rate was 49.64%, which is somewhat easier than the 2023‚Äì2024 test.

Test checks skills about MVC structure, and Development process, and a bit of SQL/Java/Unix.
