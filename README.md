## üß† Research Assistant Certificates
![Researches](./certs.png)
The award was focused on presentation.
Plus, there can be some problem while uploading collaborated code into this.
So, I attach the actual award.

![Awards](./award.png)
![IndustrialEngineer](./industrial_engineer.png)
This is a Korean certificates, for informational engineering. 

This is not 'high-leveled' certificates. But this needs some comments. 

I took 'Industrial Engineer' examination 's first screening, as I were not an undergradute student. I weas only 3rd grade.
Engineer certificates does not allow people who graduated fourth grade of the college. So, students who are not undergraduate cannot take this.

Also, colleges with 2 years courses cannot take this. In my opinion it is a kind of discrimiation.

And I took a final test in 2025. If I can get enough time to get 'Engineer' examination,

which is one step higher than 'Industrial Engineer', I have courage to take.
First screening test's pass rate was 51%. Final test's pass wate was 49.64%, which is quite easier than 2023-2024's test.

Test checks skills about MVC structure, and Development process, and a bit of SQL/Java/Unix.
